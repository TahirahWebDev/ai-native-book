# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Sim + Isaac ROS) - Tasks

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Conduct thorough review of Module 3 plan and spec in specs/ai-robot-brain-module/plan.md and specs/ai-robot-brain-module/spec.md

## Phase 2: Foundational
- [ ] T002 Research and integrate authoritative academic and industry sources on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, synthetic data, sim-to-real transfer, and edge AI deployment.

## Phase 3: Content Generation (Section 2.1)
- [ ] T003 Write content for "Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim," including installation guide and basic scene.
- [ ] T004 Develop basic Isaac Sim Python script for scene setup and running.

## Phase 4: Content Generation (Section 2.2)
- [ ] T005 Write content for "Synthetic Data Generation," explaining principles and techniques for generating datasets.
- [ ] T006 Develop Python script for synthetic data generation (object detection example).

## Phase 5: Content Generation (Section 2.3)
- [ ] T007 Write content for "Isaac ROS for Hardware-Accelerated Perception," covering SLAM, VSLAM, object detection, and multi-camera pipelines.
- [ ] T008 Develop ROS 2 launch files and Python nodes for Isaac ROS VSLAM.

## Phase 6: Content Generation (Section 2.4)
- [ ] T009 Write content for "Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation," discussing challenges and customization for bipedal movement.
- [ ] T010 Develop Nav2 configuration snippets for humanoid robot.

## Phase 7: Content Generation (Section 2.5)
- [ ] T011 Write content for "Sim-to-Real Transfer," explaining the reality gap and effective strategies.

## Phase 8: Content Generation (Section 2.6)
- [ ] T012 Write content for "Edge Deployment with Jetson Orin," outlining the workflow and optimization techniques.
- [ ] T013 Develop example script for deploying a simple AI model to Jetson Orin.

## Phase 9: /sp.implement Phase
- [ ] T014 Technical Accuracy Review: Conduct a thorough review of all technical details against official NVIDIA documentation.
- [ ] T015 Diagram Creation & Integration: Create and embed text-based diagrams into the chapter (e.g., "Isaac Sim Architecture," "Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline").
- [ ] T016 Code Testing & Validation: Ensure all developed code examples are functional and reproducible.
- [ ] T017 Word Count & Formatting Check: Confirm content length meets targets (e.g., 300-400 words per section) and Docusaurus Markdown adherence.
- [ ] T018 Final Review: Comprehensive review for clarity, consistency, and overall quality of the chapter.
- [ ] T019 Full Chapter Assembly: Combine all generated content into the final `ai-robot-brain-module.md` chapter.

## Dependencies

Story completion order:
- All phases must be completed sequentially.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Tasks within content generation phases (e.g., writing content and developing code snippets for a single section) can be executed in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on completing content generation for each section sequentially, followed by integration and review.
