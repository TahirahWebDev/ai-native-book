# Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Tasks

## Phase: `/sp.tasks`

### Content Generation (Introduction to ROS 2)
- [ ] Write detailed explanations for "What is ROS 2?" and "History and Motivation."
- [ ] Ensure Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12 level.

### Content Generation (ROS 2 Graph)
- [ ] Write detailed explanations for Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, Communication Flow, and QoS.
- [ ] Draft textual descriptions for the communication flow diagram.

### Content Generation (`rclpy`)
- [ ] Write detailed explanations for `rclpy` fundamentals.
- [ ] Elaborate on the Publisher and Subscriber code examples.
- [ ] Develop brief, illustrative code snippets for Services/Clients and Actions/Action Clients/Servers.

### Content Generation (Launch Files)
- [ ] Write detailed explanations for launch files and parameters.
- [ ] Elaborate on the provided launch file example.

### Content Generation (URDF Basics)
- [ ] Write detailed explanations for URDF, humanoid-specific elements.
- [ ] Draft textual descriptions for the URDF structure diagram.

### Content Generation (Python Agents)
- [ ] Write detailed explanations for agent-controller interaction and example flow.

### Mini-Labs Development
- [ ] Create step-by-step instructions for all three mini-labs, including expected outputs.

### Review Questions Formulation
- [ ] Ensure all review questions are clearly articulated and cover key concepts.

## Phase: `/sp.implement`

### Code Implementation and Verification
- [ ] Implement and verify all code examples (Publisher, Subscriber, Launch File, Services, Actions) are executable and correct on ROS 2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04).

### Diagram Generation
- [ ] Convert textual descriptions of communication flow and URDF structure into actual diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML, or image generation prompts).

### Citation Integration
- [ ] Integrate specific, formatted citations into the generated content.

### RAG Formatting Review
- [ ] Final review to ensure all content adheres to RAG-friendly formatting.

### Full Chapter Assembly
- [ ] Combine all generated content into the final `Module_1_ROS2.md` chapter.

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Final check for accuracy, completeness, writing level, and adherence to all `spec.md` constraints.
