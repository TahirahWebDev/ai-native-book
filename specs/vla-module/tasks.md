# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Tasks

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Conduct thorough review of Module 4 plan and spec in specs/vla-module/plan.md and specs/vla-module/spec.md

## Phase 2: Foundational
- [ ] T002 Research and integrate authoritative academic and industry sources on Vision-Language-Action systems, LLMs in robotics, OpenAI Whisper applications, and multi-modal human-robot interaction.

## Phase 3: Content Generation (Section 2.1)
- [ ] T003 Write content for "Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)," defining VLA systems and explaining the cognitive loop.

## Phase 4: Content Generation (Section 2.2)
- [ ] T004 Write content for "Voice-to-Action Pipeline with OpenAI Whisper," detailing setup, utilization, and providing code examples.
- [ ] T005 Develop Python script demonstrating OpenAI Whisper integration for speech-to-text.

## Phase 5: Content Generation (Section 2.3)
- [ ] T006 Write content for "Cognitive Planning with Large Language Models (LLMs)," explaining task decomposition and prompt engineering.
- [ ] T007 Develop Python snippets for LLM prompt engineering for robotics tasks.

## Phase 6: Content Generation (Section 2.4)
- [ ] T008 Write content for "Natural Language to ROS 2 Action Graphs," describing conversion methodologies and building action graphs.
- [ ] T009 Develop ROS 2 Python nodes for converting natural language commands to action graph components.

## Phase 7: Content Generation (Section 2.5)
- [ ] T010 Write content for "Multi-Modal Interaction and Vision Integration," exploring approaches and integrating camera feeds.
- [ ] T011 Develop ROS 2 launch files and Python scripts for multi-modal input handling.

## Phase 8: Content Generation (Section 2.6)
- [ ] T012 Write content for "Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot," providing a guided framework and outlining key tasks.
- [ ] T013 Develop full working example of a simulated VLA system for the Capstone Project.

## Phase 9: /sp.implement Phase
- [ ] T014 System Diagram Creation & Integration: Create and embed text-based diagrams into the chapter (e.g., "VLA Cognitive Loop," "Multi-Modal VLA System Architecture").
- [ ] T015 Code Testing & Validation: Ensure all developed code examples are functional and reproducible within the simulated environment.
- [ ] T016 LLM Prompt Tuning: Refine LLM prompts for optimal performance in robotic planning and decision-making.
- [ ] T017 Word Count & Formatting Check: Confirm content length meets targets (e.g., 150-200 words for section 2.1, 300-400 words for section 2.2) and Docusaurus Markdown adherence.
- [ ] T018 Final Review: Comprehensive review for technical accuracy, clarity, and overall quality, especially regarding VLA system integration and capstone readiness.
- [ ] T019 Full Chapter Assembly: Combine all generated content into the final `vla-module.md` chapter.

## Dependencies

Story completion order:
- All phases must be completed sequentially.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Tasks within content generation phases (e.g., writing content and developing code snippets for a single section) can be executed in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on completing content generation for each section sequentially, followed by integration and review.
